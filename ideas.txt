	trying to add user profiles, it's broken..

	how to delete images that are never posted, as they are stored before posting

	SECURE IT. create methods
	use sessions for showing the image is ready to be posted
	do something with the homepage
		
	add a button on each message so a user can like fav it, so it gets like repinned/posted whatever on their own profile, like tumblr
	homepage, subscriptions
	
	limit username length!?
	friends list + private messages
	profile page listing activity


	view profile, save(pin), private message, add to friends


future
	setup amazon for image hosting
	paginate (infinite scroll?)



publish states simply what data should be available for the client to query on

subscribe lets the client see it
